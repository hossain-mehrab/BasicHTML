      In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text
      commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface
      without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a
      placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily
      replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to
      consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the
      text influencing the design. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version
      of 'De finibus bonorum et malorum', a 1st century BC text by the Roman
      statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed
      to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. Versions of the Lorem ipsum
      text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was
      popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum
      was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed
      it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing
      program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and
      Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX
